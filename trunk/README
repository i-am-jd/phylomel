This bioinformatics projet will allow users to create and draw phylogenetic trees. To this intent the project will consist of an OCaml library and executables for the end user.

The current implementation only supports clustering methods (upgma and wpgma) and svg output. Still, it is already used on the site www.mlva.eu, a european genotypes database.

I intend to implement soon unrooted trees (neighbour joining and minimum spanning tree) and pdf (and/or postscript, perhaps using mlPost).

For the moment, I also have a program drawing minimum spanning trees using a force-based layout. Unfornately it is very slow, but I intend to tackle this using spatial decomposition.

Pylomel is a computer system creating and drawing phylogenetic trees. It is currently in alpha state, but already supports the UPGMA and WPGMA clustering methods and outputs SVG files.

This program is used by this europen genotypes database : www.mlva.eu
